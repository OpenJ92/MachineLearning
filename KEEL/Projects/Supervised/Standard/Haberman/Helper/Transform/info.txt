We seek to automate the transformation process of our dataset to a certain extent. As
it is said in a few of the articles below, the abstract type of each column should dictate
the transformation applied to it. In my mind there are 4 such abstract types [1] Continuous, 
Nominal, Dichotomous and Ordinal. These labels, and others as they come up, should be found
in the Load class attributes which comes from the {project name}-names.txt file in the Data/ 
directory in each project. ie.

@attribute Sex Nominal {M,F,I}
@attribute Length Continuous [0.075,0.815]
@attribute Diameter Continuous [0.055,0.65]
@attribute Height Continuous [0.0,1.13]
@attribute Whole_weight Continuous [0.0020,2.8255]
@attribute Shucked_weight Continuous [0.0010,1.488]
@attribute Viscera_weight Continuous [0.0005,0.76]
@attribute Shell_weight Continuous [0.0015,1.005]
@attribute Rings Nominal {15,7,9,10,8,20,16,19,14,11,12,18,13,5,4,6,21,17,22,1,3,26,23,29,2,27,25,24}

these labels should inform the transform object how to carry out it's processes. Default processes will 
be implemented bur the user(me) should be able to override these processes given the need arises.

The following is a description of each key word we expect to see:

Continuous: real columns that can take on any bounded value.
Nominal: integer columns that are categorical and have no sense of >.
Dichotomous: integer columns that are categorical but with only two possibilities.
Ordinal: integer columns that are categorical with some sense of >.

This is an amazing article on sklearn's pipline suite and will be perfectly suitable for
our construction.
